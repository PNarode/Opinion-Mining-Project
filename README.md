Opinion-Mining-Project
======================
It's an Opinion Mining Project that takes a text file as input to the code and generate a Bar-Graph featuring the scoring 
of the features that included in the text.

Download the Stanford Parser at "http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-parser-full-2014-06-16.zip"

After downloading that extract the content and copy the file:
1. "stanford-parser.jar"
2. "stanford-parser-3.4-models.jar"

to the folder in which you have all these files stored.

For example let the input to the code be:

"The video quality of phone is excellent."
"The picture quality is not good."

Then it will generate a output bargraph showing:

video quality with score 4 and audio with -2 that too in graphical format.
