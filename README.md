Opinion-Mining-Project
======================
It's an Opinion Mining Project that takes a text file as input to the code and generate a Bar-Graph featuring the scoring 
of the features that included in the text.


For example let the input to the code be:

"The video quality of phone is excellent."
"The picture quality is not good."

Then it will generate a output bargraph showing:

video quality with score 4 and audio with -2 that too in graphical format.
